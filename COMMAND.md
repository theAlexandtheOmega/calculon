USING CALCULON, THE ACTING BOT: 
Calculon, MASTER OF ACTING, is now available to help you express your DEEPEST SORROWS and GREATEST pants JOOOOYS. Use is simple, there is only a single command, and it is used like so:
$emote is a bad ass mother fucker. 
which the bot will act out for you as:
@<youruser> is a bad ass motherfucker.

note your command message will be deleted. 
note also that since I put this together in 40 mins or so, there might be a way to do something stupid and hacky to it, but there are like 8 of us, so you'd just get banned.

CALCULON:
now does coin $flips, you can call heads tails (or edge). 
self explanatory.


Calculon ATT (A.dvanced T.rolling T.echnology)

Thanks to Calculon and your hard earned Calcu-Cash you can!

 or clear the current target out.

secret commands for calculon as follows: 
$mark <mention another user> stores that users id until the bot is restarted or the mark is cleared
prints:
<user mentioned> suddenly feels nervous.
$mark <no arg> clears any formerly marked user 
prints
calculon doesn't do impressions
$frame <a string describing an action> functions identically to $emote, but uses the $mark stored username instead of your own. 
example:
$mark @Ronnie 
$frame hammers a bowling pin deeply into his butt.(edited)

Calculon Update: 
command !setAdmin
Usage:
!setAdmin <set|unset> <playertag>
adds or removes the bot_admin flag for the specified user. 
bot admins are capable of using the mute command and others as I write them, generally utility features such as turning off and on bot functions controlling logging channels etc etc.
needless to say, won't work on me.
calculon updates: 
$mark is now persistent through updates, and server specific. 
$give <amount> @person is now available for point transfer
dev notes: 
methods added to scores SQLObject specific to adding, subtracting points
server table added to db, methods for setting clearing and checking marked user
Calculon Update: 
admin functions- !ap 
Usage:
!ap <number>
adds <number> points to your score. Self use only, admin only.

Calculon Update: 
Mute Command: 
admin users can now mute a player through calculon without changing the users role. 
usage: 
$mute on <user tag> 
$mute off <user tag> 
$mute check <user tag> 
admins can not be muted.
Calculon additional mute notes:
muting is implemented by calculon keeping an eye out for muted users posting to any channel and then deletes their posts immediately. 
coming soon: 
logging channel, so that we know what posts are being deleted, lol. probably should have done this first.
